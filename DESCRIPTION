Description: 
  In contrast to other large-scale network models for propagation of electrical
  activity in neural tissue that have no analytical solutions for their dynamics, we show
  that for a specific class of integrate and fire neural networks the acceleration depends
  quadratically on the instantaneous speed of the activity propagation. We use this
  property to analytically compute the network spike dynamics and to highlight the
  emergence of a natural time scale for evolution of the traveling waves. These results
  allow us to examine other applications of this model such as the effect that a nonconductive
  gap of tissue has on further activity propagation. Furthermore we show
  that activity propagation also depends on local conditions for other more general
  connectivity functions, by converting the evolution equations for network dynamics
  into a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. This approach
  greatly enhances our intuition into the mechanisms of the traveling waves evolution
  and significantly reduces the simulation time for this class of models.
  Furthermore, with this package you can examine how inhomogeneities affect the dynamics of the 
  activity propagation.
