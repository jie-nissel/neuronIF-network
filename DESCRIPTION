Description: 
  In contrast to other large-scale network models for propagation of electrical
  activity in neural tissue that have no analytical solutions for their dynamics, we show
  that for a specific class of integrate-and-fire neural network the acceleration depends
  quadratically on the instantaneous speed of the activity propagation. 
  Furthermore, with this package you can examine how inhomogeneities affect the dynamics of the 
  activity propagation.
